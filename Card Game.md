# Basic description of this game.  
When a company executes a project, it is often necessary to prepare several solutions to the same problem or expect to use one solution to solve multiple problems. Using different solutions to solve the same problem will have different impacts on different aspects, as will trying to solve multiple problems using the same solution. The game is designed to help project managers holistically consider the impacts of problems and solutions and select the best solution at a non-technical level.

- As an example, the following chart shows the score obtained for different questions corresponding to different methods.
